ðŸ“¦ EDI 850 â†’ JSON Parser (Repo 1)
ðŸ”¹ Overview

This project parses a Purchase Order (EDI 850 file) into structured JSON format for easier processing and automation in Supply Chain/EDI workflows.
EDI data is usually received in raw text with delimiters (* and ~). This script extracts key information like PO Number, Buyer, Seller, Line Items, and Total Amount into machine-readable JSON.

ðŸ”¹ Why this project?

EDI 850 (Purchase Order) is one of the most common supply chain transactions.
JSON makes it easier to analyze, automate, and connect with AI or RPA pipelines.
Forms the foundation for AI-driven supply chain automation (summaries, anomaly detection, dashboards).

ðŸ”¹ Features

âœ… Reads raw EDI 850 text file (sample_850.txt)
âœ… Extracts PO Number, Buyer, Seller, Items
âœ… Calculates Total Amount from quantities Ã— prices
âœ… Saves structured JSON (po.json)
âœ… Simple, extensible Python script (edi850_to_json.py)

ðŸ”¹ Example

Input (EDI 850 segment):-

BEG*00*SA*XX-1234**20170301**NA~
N1*BY*ABC AEROSPACE*9*1234567890101~
PO1*1*25*EA*36*PE*MG*XYZ-1234~


Output (po.json):-

{
  "PO_Number": "XX-1234",
  "Buyer": "ABC AEROSPACE",
  "Seller": null,
  "Items": [
    {
      "Line": "1",
      "Qty": "25",
      "Quantity_UOM": "EA",
      "Price": "36",
      "Item_ID": "XYZ-1234"
    }
  ],
  "TotalAmount": 900.0
}


ðŸ”¹ Next Steps (Planned)

AI-based PO summarization (using GenAI).
Supplier performance analytics.
Integration with AWS S3 for storage + RPA automation triggers.
