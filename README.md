# ðŸ“¦ EDI 850 â†’ JSON Parser (Repo 1)

---

## ðŸ”¹ Overview
This project parses a Purchase Order (**EDI 850 file**) into structured JSON format for easier processing and automation in Supply Chain/EDI workflows.  

EDI data is usually received in raw text with delimiters (`*` and `~`).  
This script extracts key information like **PO Number, Buyer, Seller, Line Items, and Total Amount** into machine-readable JSON.
